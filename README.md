# pbot3 | A Dockerized, GPT assisted, mean-spirited Discord bot. 

![](shodan_transparent.png)

What if SHODAN's pettyness and cruelty were directed at a hapless Discord server?

<br><br>

Do your friends need to be put in their place?

Have they grown soft and complacent within the confines of their confortable private server?

Release pbot in your Discord server and allow her to scortch and salt the earth.

Minimal effort approach: throw a copy of pbot onto a spare raspberry pi in a tmux session and spew bad vibes into the noosphere passively. :sleeping::boom::broken_heart::hurtrealbad:
